## Soul ID Setup Guide

**Purpose:** Lock character facial features across all video/image generations for consistency.

### Setup Steps
1. **Gather photos**: 10-20 reference photos of the character/person
   - Various angles (front, 3/4, profile)
   - Various expressions (neutral, smiling, serious)
   - Consistent lighting preferred
   - High resolution (720p+ face region)
2. **Create Soul ID** in Higgsfield:
   - Navigate to Soul ID section
   - Upload reference photos
   - Name the identity
   - Processing takes ~5 minutes
3. **Attach to generations**:
   - Select the Soul ID before generating
   - Works across all models
   - Character face stays consistent across clips

### When to Use Soul ID
- Multi-shot sequences with the same character
- Storyboard mode
- Series of images/videos with recurring characters
- Any project requiring character consistency

## Popcorn Storyboard Guide

**Purpose:** Create multi-shot video sequences with visual consistency.

### How to Use
1. **Enter Popcorn Auto Mode**
2. **Upload 6-8 key frames** (images that define each shot)
3. **Lead with visual style**: First frame sets the tone
4. **Add subject after style**: Subsequent frames refine character and action
5. **Popcorn generates transitions** between your key frames

### Tips
- Consistent art style across key frames = better results
- Vary shot sizes (wide -> medium -> close-up -> wide)
- Include establishing shots for context
- Keep character descriptions identical across frames

## Cinema Studio 2.0 Guide

**Purpose:** High-quality cinematic video generation with frame-by-frame control.

### Workflow
1. **Create Hero Frame**: Generate or upload the perfect starting frame
2. **Refine the frame**: Adjust lighting, composition, color grading
3. **Add motion**: Apply camera movement and subject animation
4. **Preview and iterate**: Review output, adjust motion parameters
5. **Render final**: Generate full-quality output

### When to Use
- Maximum quality required
- Complex camera movements
- Precise control over starting frame
- Professional/commercial projects

## Enhance Toggle Guidance

| Enhance | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| **OFF** (recommended) | Most generations -- models handle detail well natively |
| **ON** | Only when output looks soft or lacks detail after generation |

**Default recommendation: OFF.** Enhance can sometimes alter the intended style or add unwanted sharpening artifacts. Test without it first.
